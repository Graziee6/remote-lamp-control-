Our OTI Light Switching Project (Glowify) is a system where a user is able to turn lights on or off from their device.
By using Glowify application, a user can control the lighting system in his/her house and be able to turn lights on or off wherever he/she is at whatever time.
In addition, when there is natural light, users can get reminders to turn off the lights and when it is night to turn them on, in order to prevent the electricity wastage.
